# Oniun
## Introduction
Oniun is a specification of a set of languages, designed to be compiled together to create software.
Oniun strives to form a natural extension and streamlining of modern day OOP, keeping an open standard that can be implemented and adopted as necessary.
Oniun evolved from now defunct [JOI Library](https://gitlab.com/joi-library), a more code oriented and Java-tied project to improve OOP.
Oniun as a specification is platform independent, only defining the general elements within implementing languages and compilers.

Oniun 1.0.0 is currently in development. Most choices for the specification have been made, however a specification document and reference implementation are still underway.
